# 🎰 CodeBreaker: CodeBreaker Game with AI Solvers

A Python-based implementation of the classic **CodeBreaker** game — with a GUI, probability-based helper hints, and solver strategies.
---

## 🎮 Features

- 🎨 **Interactive GUI** with color pickers and feedback system
- 🎯 **Custom difficulty**: Adjustable code length and color pool
- 🔍 **Smart hints**: Probability-based suggestions after each guess
- 🤖 **Solver AI bots**:
  - **Random Guesser**
  - **Knuth’s Algorithm**
  - **Greedy Solver**
- 📊 **Benchmarking engine**: Run simulations for different configurations, track average guesses & runtimes

---

## 🧩 Gameplay

Try to guess the hidden color sequence within limited attempts. After each guess:
- ⚫ Black peg = correct color in the correct position
- ⚪ Gray peg = correct color but wrong position
- ⬜ Light gray = incorrect color

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can customize:
- Number of colors (`4–10`)
- Code length (`4–6`)
- Get Probability hints

Modify values in `app/settings.py` or pass as parameters in solver/benchmark scripts.
